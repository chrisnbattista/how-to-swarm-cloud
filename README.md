# how-to-swarm

A project exploring the potential of machine learning to uncover the fundamental dynamics of a complex multi-actor system.

Prior work on particle simulation has been done and folded into the PyPI at https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr/perso/daniele.coslovich/atooms/ - may be worth forking this codebase / contributing any particle sim learnings back.

Similarly, an academic paper has been published to describe a Python library for developing SPH simulations - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04504.pdf

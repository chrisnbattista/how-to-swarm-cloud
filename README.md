# how-to-swarm

A project exploring the potential of machine learning to uncover the fundamental dynamics of a complex multi-actor system.

## How to install
- Clone the repo
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run
- python lj_test.py

## Notes on prior work by others
- Prior work on particle simulation has been done and folded into the PyPI at https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr/perso/daniele.coslovich/atooms/ - may be worth forking this codebase / contributing any particle sim learnings back.

- Similarly, an academic paper has been published to describe a Python library for developing SPH simulations - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04504.pdf
